## Inspiration

PolymathAI was inspired by the desire to make lifelong learning more personalized, efficient, and enjoyable. We noticed that many learners struggle to balance multiple interests and skills, and often lack tailored guidance to help them progress. Our goal was to create an AI-powered platform that acts as a personal learning coach, helping users set goals, prioritize skills, and stay motivated on their journey to becoming a true polymath.

## What it does

PolymathAI is an AI-driven learning assistant that helps users:
- Select and prioritize multiple skills they want to learn or improve
- Set daily learning hours and preferred study times
- Generate a personalized, AI-optimized daily schedule
- Track progress and completion rates for each skill
- Log daily learning reflections and receive instant AI-powered feedback
- Complete quick AI-generated assessments to reinforce learning
- Visualize progress and analytics over time

## How we built it

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and React for a fast, modern, and responsive user experience.
- **Authentication & Database:** Utilizes Supabase for user authentication and profile management.
- **AI Integration:** Integrates Google Gemini (via @google/genai) to generate personalized schedules, assessment questions, and feedback.
- **State Management:** Uses localStorage for quick, client-side persistence of user progress, logs, and schedules.
- **UI/UX:** Custom CSS for a clean, motivating, and accessible interface.
